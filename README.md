Elastic JS is an HTML5 and Javascript MapReduce framework. It runs on the Internet or any TCP/IP network. It relies on modern web browsers to run MapReduce Jobs.  Volunteers computers can join Elastic JS by just opening a web page and can either upload job to be executed by other volunteers computers in Elastic JS or act as a job worker that execute jobs uploaded by others. In this report, we discuss the design and the implementation of Elastic JS.
